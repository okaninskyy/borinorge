  "quote-teacher": "I have a student in 2nd grade from Ukraine. Understands almost nothing Norwegian. Нe didn’t like Campus and refused to put on headphones. I checked the language setting and changed it to Ukrainian. Put the headset on him so he could hear. His instinct was to rip them off again, but as he took them off he stopped again and slowly put them back on. Then he fell silent before lighting up with a huge smile! And then he started counting out loud along with the video in Ukrainian. He really enjoyed himself! It was actually quite touching! 😀 It made a big difference!",
  "campus-reklame": "The video lectures in Campus Math 1-7 are now available in Ukrainian. Increment has been helped by Ukrainian refugees, who have translated the videos and control tasks and read in the Ukrainian voices. This is how mathematics has been made available to the Ukrainian students who attend Norwegian classes."
