  "description": "In the fall of 2022, we started the Alias online project. The idea was to be able to play a traditional game with people who are physically in different places but come together online to practice the Norwegian language. Vadym Kaninsky created the website for this, which underwent significant changes over half a year. Alias online was improved with the help of artificial intelligence, and a version of the game was introduced where one can play alone, directly communicating with a bot. During this time, we conducted two gaming sessions for Ukrainians studying Norwegian.",
  "quote": "\"In the fall of 2023, I established a group for Norwegians studying Ukrainian and conducted 10 Alias online games in Ukrainian and a bit of Norwegian as part of my initiative, as an addition and as oral practice for the course from the University of Oslo. This was a fantastic experience!\" - Oksana Donets, project leader.",
