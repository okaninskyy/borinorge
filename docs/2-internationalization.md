# Internationalization

## Introduction

For the new version of Next.js 13/14 app directory check out this [blog post](https://locize.com/blog/next-app-dir-i18n/).
It describes how to add internationalization to the app in six steps.

In this project only four steps are implemented:

1. Folder structure;
2. Language detection;
3. i18n instrumentation;
4. Language switcher.

The last two steps are not implemented as unnecessary for this project:

5. Client side
6. Bonus
